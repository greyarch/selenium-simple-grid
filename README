The Selenium Simple Grid is a Node.js implementation of the popular Selenium Grid.
I got sick of trying to figure out how to extend the original Selenium Grid in order to get it to do some simple stuff and decided to see if it was possible to do this in a much simpler way.
It only took about 50 lines of Node.js code to get the same behavior - the only part I did not implement was the registration mechanism. It does not add much value for the added complexity.
Anyway, now we have a much, much more maintainable and extensible selenium grid. Enjoy it.

Installation:

First install node.js, like so (on Ubuntu):

    sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install nodejs

Then install jade. Easiest way to do that is if you first install npm, like so:

    sudo apt-get install npm

and then:

    npm install jade

Configure the selenium servers (nodes) in the config.js
Start the hub with "nodejs app.js"
